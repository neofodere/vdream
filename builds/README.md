>[!IMPORTANT]
>Keep in mind that issues found in a specific version will almost always affect previous versions as well.

## V.Dream `v.1.0` ***(Original release)***
>[!NOTE]
>🕝 Release date: 20/12/2025
### Known Issues:
Setting a corrupted image—or a file with a .png or .jpg extension that wasn’t actually an image—as a cover could cause the emulator to crash and fail to start until the generated copy inside the \covers folder was removed.


## V.Dream `v.1.1`:
>[!NOTE]
>🕝 Release date: 26/12/2025
### Fixes and additions:
- Fixed an issue where setting a corrupted image—or a file with a .png or .jpg extension that wasn’t actually an image—as a cover would cause the emulator to crash and refuse to start until the generated copy inside the \covers folder was deleted.

- Added the MIT license for the V.Dream core directly inside the software to keep future distributions clean and to comply with the MIT License when distributing V.Dream on platforms that don’t allow long project descriptions or uploading text files.

- Minor visual polish and small aesthetic improvements.


## V.Dream `v.1.2`:
>[!NOTE]
>🕝 Release date: 27/12/2025
### Fixes and additions:
- The startup loading time has been reduced to less than half compared to versions v.1.0 and v.1.1.

- The startup window now includes a new method that initializes the configuration to the default settings if it was deleted or didn’t exist.

- Now, in addition to handling the error when trying to set an invalid image as a cover, the program automatically deletes the corrupted copy.

- Minor visual polish and small aesthetic improvements.


## V.Dream `v1.3`:
>[!NOTE]
>🕝 Release date: 29/12/2025
### Fixes and additions:
- Startup time has been reduced even further.

- You can now drag a game file directly onto V.Dream’s main window.

- ROM analysis has been optimized to more efficiently determine whether a file is valid.

- A scaling issue has been fixed that occasionally cut some window buttons in half.

- An issue has been fixed where importing two different images—one JPG and one PNG—for the same game caused conflicts.

- Fixed a minor issue where you had to restart the program before you could delete a cover after setting it for the first time.

- The version numbering has been changed from the ‘v.x.x’ style to the ‘vx.x’ style for greater consistency.

### Known issues:
- The emulator does not accept the 16 MB ROMs, which correspond to ***Disney•Pixar Cars 2***, ***Disney•Pixar Toy Story 3***, and ***DreamWorks Shrek: Forever After***.

- In French (AZERTY keyboard), the controls in the Controls window are incorrectly mapped; the corrected version is already available in the project's GitHub under `docs/vdream_controls.txt`.
